description: 'Example of student work: project presentation on an extensible planetary
  surface transportation system. This year''s design effort focused on crewed surface
  mobility systems for the Moon, Mars, and analog sites on Earth, supporting the Vision
  for Space Exploration (VSE). The VSE calls for human exploration of the Moon, preparing
  the way for human Mars missions. In this plan, lunar exploration begins with robotic
  orbital and surface missions while crewed vehicles are developed. Crewed missions
  to the Moon would begin with so-called sortie missions operationally similar to
  the Apollo J-type missions, with multiple EVAs and geologic excursions from the
  lander. Subsequent missions would build up a permanently occupied outpost similar
  to Antarctic research stations. Later missions would begin Mars development, beginning
  around 2030, using conjunction-class trajectories to provide surface stays of 500-600
  days.'
