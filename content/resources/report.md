description: 'Example of student work: final design report on a lunar telescope facility.
  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has outlined plans to return
  humans to the Moon by the year 2020. Because of the inherent advantages in performing
  astronomy from the lunar surface, the Moon has long been envisioned as a possible
  site for a space telescope. With the most recent lunar plans serving as a motivation
  and basis for reconsideration of the Moon as the location of an astronomical observatory,
  this report provides a thorough investigation into the design of a lunar telescope
  facility.'
